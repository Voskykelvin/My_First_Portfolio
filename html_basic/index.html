    <h1>Facts About Constantine The Great</h1>

    <h2>1. It Started in Serbia</h2>
    <p>Constantine’s full name was Flavius Valerius Constantinus. He was born in the city of Naissus (now known as the Serbian city of Nis) around 280 AD.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Constantine would reign as Roman Emperor for an astonishing 31 years. While that might not seem like too long, keep in mind the incredibly high mortality rate among the emperors of Rome. Constantine was actually the second-longest serving emperor in Roman history. Only Augustus ruled longer than him.</p>

    <h2>Change in Partners</h2>
    <p>Constantine’s parents were a Roman officer named Constantius Chlorus and his consort, Helena. However, things would change when Constantine was a child. Chlorus set Helena aside to marry Theodora, who was the stepdaughter of Maximian. At that point in Rome’s history, two emperors ruled the vast empire at the same time. Maximian had been chosen by the emperor Diocletian to be the second emperor.</p>
    <h3>Late Bloomer</h3>
    <p>Despite being hailed as a saint by the Eastern Orthodox Church, Constantine was only baptized on his deathbed. Granted, he was canonized for his actions rather than his conversion, but it feels like a suitably ironic fact to mention!</p>
